# This is a list of negative-intentioned words, copiled from a variety of sources.
# It began as an adjective-only list, but there were too many intention-identifying,
# commonly used words out there that didn't fall under that part of speech.
#
# This is both the most comprehensive and the most pruned list of it's sort that I've
# come across in my search for lists of this sort for use in NLP-type projects. Many
# other lists include tons of words that could "go either way", and therefore muddy
# the results of any application they are applied to.
#
# This list was compiled and combed by hand several times over for quality and coverage.
# I've used this list alone to do sentiment prediction on Kaggle reviews datasets with
# remarkably accuratee results.
#
# Enjoy, and if you do, please give credit. I revisit this frequently, last edit: 2021-08-10
